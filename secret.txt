Lay beside me and tell me what they've done
And speak the words I wanna hear to make my demons run
The door is locked now but it's open if you're true
If you can understand the me then I can understand the you

Lay beside me, under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this, paralyzed
The door cracks open but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still but there's no sun shining through
No there's no sun shining through, no there's no sun shining

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?

Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there
'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?
